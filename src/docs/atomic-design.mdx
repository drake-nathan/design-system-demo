# Atomic Design

![Atomic Design](/atomic.png)

## Atoms

Atoms are single UI elements that can't be broken down further. They are the building blocks of our design system.

### Label

```tsx
<Label>Label</Label>
```

<Canvas of={LabelStories.Basic} />

### Input

```tsx
<Input placeholder="Input" />
```

<Canvas of={InputStories.Basic} />

## Molecules

Molecules are groups of basic elements that are often paired together.

### Textfield

<Canvas of={TextfieldStories.Basic} />

### Abstracted

```tsx
<Textfield id="name" label="Name" placeholder="Bender Bending Rodriguez" />
```

### Composable

```tsx
<Textfield>
  <Label htmlFor="name">Name</Label>
  <Input
    id="name"
    required
    type="name"
    placeholder="Bender Bending Rodriguez"
  />
</Textfield>
```

## Organisms

"Organisms are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms." - Brad Frost

### Login Card

<Canvas of={LoginCardStories.Basic} />
